# Privacy policy 
This is an Android app developed by Pekka Hyytinen. The app available on Google Play store.

The app is not open source, at least as of yet. This repository only contains information about privacy policy required
by Google for submitting apps to Play store. 

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences like theme, etc.) created by the user is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Pekka Hyytinen
